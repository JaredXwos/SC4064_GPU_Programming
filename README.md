# SC4064_GPU_Programming
This repository holds all my assignments for SC4064 GPU Programming

.pbs files are included but without the working directory and the project name, so those have to be added in to submit .pbs.
Similarly build result files are included (to show ptx info), but working directory and username have been replaced with a placeholder.

I hope these can be useful to anyone taking the course (or similar).
